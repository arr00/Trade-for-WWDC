# Trade-for-WWDC
Trade for WWDC provides a platform for WWDC participants to trade apple swag at the event.

This was built for WWDC 2018 as a pin trading app. Unfortunatly, I had a battle with the App Store review team for weeks leading up to the event. Unfortunatly, I they rejected it many times and I couldn't get it on the App Store.
